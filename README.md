# GitHub Shell

<img alt="about" src="docs/images/about.png">

`ghsh` (or Github shell) is a command line tool available for windows, linux and macos that lets you use github as a shell. It is not another `github cli` ofc. It is extensible so you can easily create & add your own commands. You can go into specific folder and edit files right there. Ships only a single executable.

iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''))
```

### Linux
