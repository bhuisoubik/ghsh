## Documentation

#### `ghsh` is a cross-platform Github shell. It is not another `github cli` ofc. It is extensible i.e. you can easily create & add your own commands. Checkout [Get Started](#Get-Started).

### Get Started
**Installation**

Windows
```

```

MacOS
```

```

Linux
```

```

To check if it was correctly installed, try running the following command in your `terminal`

```
ghsh vsn
```
This should print.
```
ghsh: Version: <current-version>
```

**Building from `src`**

If you want to build the src then check out the [Build.md](BUILD.md)

### Developing new Commands

Checkout [how to create/add new commands](DEVELOP_COMMANDS.md).

You can also create a [Pull Request](CONTRIBUTING.md) to add your commands to the `master` branch of this [repo](https://www.github.com/soubikbhuiwk007/ghsh).
